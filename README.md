# **DECODING BRAND SENTIMENTS: A MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH**

**Background Information**

In today's digital era, Twitter and other social media platforms profoundly influence consumer opinions about brands and products. Tweets serve as a reflection of public sentiment—positive, negative, or neutral—toward specific brands or products. These sentiments significantly shape brand reputation, consumer trust, and buying decisions.

**Challenges in Sentiment Analysis**

- The overwhelming volume of tweets makes manual analysis impractical and time-consuming.
Tweets often contain slang, emojis, and abbreviations, which complicate text analysis.
- Accurately distinguishing between similar sentiments (e.g., sarcasm vs. genuine praise) poses a challenge.

**Stakeholders**

**Brands and Marketing Teams:** To understand public perception, adjust marketing strategies, and improve product offerings.
Product Managers: To gather insights into consumer pain points and develop solutions.

**Competitors:** To benchmark performance and identify competitive advantages.

**Proposed Solution (Analysis & Modeling)**

The project proposes a machine learning-based sentiment analysis system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The model will classify tweets about Apple and Google products into sentiment categories (positive, neutral, negative), providing actionable insights for marketing, product development, and competitive benchmarking

**Objectives**

The aim of this project is to design and implement a sentiment analysis system that accurately classifies tweets into various sentiment categories, providing actionable insights for brands and product stakeholders.

Other objectives are as follows:
- Develop an NLP model to classify tweets about Apple and Google products as positive, negative, or neutral, providing actionable insights into customer sentiment.
- Optimize the model's performance using text preprocessing, feature engineering, and iterative evaluations to ensure high accuracy and reliability.
- Analyze sentiment trends to support strategic decision-making for marketing, product development, and competitive benchmarking
- Compare the two brands' perceptions by people by analyzing which brand has more positive tweets and negative tweets.

**Metrics of Success**

- **Accuracy:** Achieve ≥85% correct sentiment classifications.
- **Precision:** Attain ≥80% accuracy in predicting positive/negative sentiments.
- **Recall:** Ensure ≥80% identification of actual positive/negative sentiments.
- **F1-Score:** Maintain ≥80% balance between precision and recall.
